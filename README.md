## Hi there! 👋 I'm Usama Bin Nadeem — a Full-Stack Software Engineer @ Canonical 🚀

With over **5 years of hands-on experience**, I specialize in building robust, scalable web applications. I’ve worn multiple hats — startup hustler, mentor, problem solver, and open source contributor — and I’m passionate about delivering real value through code.

💼 Currently, I’m working at **Canonical** on **Ubuntu Essentials**, a certification program to empower and validate Ubuntu users worldwide. I love working with a diverse tech stack and solving real-world problems through clean, maintainable code.
